4) Show screenshots of face extrusion.  
**Not implemented.**  

5) Show a screenshot of a mesh you designed yourself starting from 'cube.off' and using the GUI supplied editing operations, as well as sqrt3 subdivision and face extrusion. Make sure to also save the mesh under the name 'design.off', commit and push it.  
    
After many unsuccessful attempts to design a mesh that makes sense, I was able to create a mesh that resembles a mouse.
